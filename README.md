# List of completed challenges

### adjacentElementsProduct
     Example
     [1,2,3,4,5]
     This code seeks the greatest multiplication of pairs
     Result [4,5] = 20

### shapeAreaPolygon
    Example
    [2]
    See imageC1
    Result = 5
    
### makeArrayConsecutive    
    Example
    [6,2,3,8]
    This algorithm orders a list of Int from the smallest to the largest and returns how many
    more numbers are needed to make the ladder between the smallest and the largest
    Result = 3 -> [2,3,6,8] -> [2,3,{4,5},6,{7},8] = {3}
    
### matrixElementsSum    
    Example
    [[0, 1, 1, 2],
     [0, 5, 0, 0],
     [2, 0, 3, 3]]
    This algorithm adds all the values ​​of the matrix that do not have a zero above them
    See image C2
    Result = 9
    
### allLongestStrings    
    Example
    [[Ocean, Sun, Moon, Universe],
    This algorithm returns the longest word in a string list
    Result = Universe
    
### commonCharacterCount    
    Example
    [Share, Sure],
    This algorithm returns the number of equal characters between two words
    Result = 3 [S, R, E]
    
### sortByHeight    
    Example
    [-1, 150, -1, -1, 190, 140, 130, -1],
    This algorithm returns a list ordered by height without ignoring obstacles (-1).
    Result = [-1, 130, -1, -1, 140, 150, 190, -1]
   
### alternatingSums    
    Example
    [57, 53, 101, 31] = 242,
    This algorithm receives a list of integers and returns an alternative sound for all elements.
    Result = [158, 84] = 242
   
### addBorder    
    Example
    [Kotlin],
    This algorithm receives a list of strings and draws a border with *.
              [********]
     Result = [*Kotlin*]
              [********]
              
### areSimilar    
    Example
    Z = (A = [1,2,3] B = [3,2,1]) \\ W = (A = [1,2,3,4] B = [4,3,2,1])
    This algorithm receives two lists of integers and verify that they are similar.
    Result = Z = True and W = false
    exchangeLimit controls the limit of possible swaps to obtain a similarity
    a.zip(b).filter { it.first != it.second }.count() -> count similarity
